# What

What is a collection of site activity based menu items. Over time more menus will be added. This file will attempt to describe what each menu item does.

**The information below is for the current repository version (read: beta) of What!!**


## Slim (slim_menu.php)

The Slim menu is a basic "since your last visit" menu with a slight twist in that only items that are new are displayed.
The functions of this menu item can also be seen in the core "login_menu" plugin in a similar form.


## Fatty (fatty_menu.php)

The Fatty menu provides new items that have happened within the last N days, where N is a configurable time frame (in seconds).
Like the Slim menu, only items that should be displayed are displayed. The layout of this menu is similar to the "whappen" plugin
that is used on the plugins.e107.org site.


## Twobyfour (twobyfour_menu.php)

The Twobyfour menu will display all the members that have visited your site in the last 24 hours.
